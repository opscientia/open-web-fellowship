### Overview

The greatest treasure mankind can save for its future generations is knowledge. Knowledge in any form should be secured and never be lost. This project focuses on scientific knowledge of any form including research papers, preprints, writeups and thesis which could be open source. It will be built on 'Arweave' which assures that the papers uploaded on the platform will never be lost (would stay for thousands of years without any additional costs) and it is decentralized. 

The project is built on arweave because Arweave helps in storing any kind of document almost permanently. They do this by taking an upfront cost of 200 years for saving the documents which is as less as 0.005 dollars per megabyte. Due to technological advancements, every year the cost of storage decreases by almost 30 percent. This keeps adding more and more years of storage to the upfront cost paid and hence the documents/articles gets stored permanently.

One other major goal of this project is that you can donate crypto tokens to the research paper, preprints, articles, thesis etc. which you find helpful. It is also possible to keep your papers public or private depending upon whether you want to safegaurd your work for yourself or if you like it to be open in public domain. The future goal would be to create a token called 'scholar' wich could be donated to important research projects asking for funds. As the platform will be built on Arweave, the necessary information and guidance about the token is already available.

### Implementation Plan

The first goal of this project is to create a platform which makes the uploads, donations, making papers public or private on web 3 possible. The first task of creating the frontend is already in the process. This project is using Flutter and Arweave.js to make the project on web 3 possible. I would be first making sure that the log in is possible with a wallet and a keyfile. After that task is done, focus will be on uploading the documents along with having proper sections for abstract, author names, subject etc. The next step after this would be to create a public and private section for uploading the documents and the last step would be make donations possible to the author in crypto tokens by anyone who wants to donate to a particular paper.

If time permits, the next task would be to create 'scholar' tokens within a given timeframe. I am fully dedicated to this project and would be working full time solely for this project during the 12 weeks. 

### Minimum Deliverables

The minimum outcome of this research is to make the platform ready with all the funtionalities mentioned above. This would be possible as the work in already in progress. 

### Timeline

| Week      | Activity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1      | Deliverable : Get familiar with the Arweave ecosystem, scalability of Arweave and the best implementation plan of Arweave in the project. Submit a document covering all the above aspects by the end of week 1. |
| 2      | Deliverable : : By the end of this week, create a basic architecture of the website. Confirm the final UI/UX for the project and set KPIs.       |
| 3      | Deliverable : Start the development process. Create a landing page with necessary information and guide.  |
| 4      | Deliverable :  Create 2 log in options: First would be log in via Arweave key file and the second would be log in via walletconnect which is used by Arweave and is similar to metamask     |
| 5      | Deliverable : Create an option to upload files including various sections like ‘author name’, ‘abstract’, ‘title of the project’, ‘subject’ and final pdf upload.       |
| 6      | Deliverable : Create two sections called ‘public’ and ‘private’ for uploading articles       |
| 7      | Deliverable : Check upon all the deliverables till week 6 and debug any issue that has arisen. Also create presentation and get mid term performance review by the community. **Mid-term performance review / community feedback**        |
| 8      | Deliverable : Create a proper front end for the papers uploaded so that the audience visiting would be able to download them and see various section separately.   |
| 9      | Deliverable :  Create a ‘donate’ option for all the papers which would make donations to the author possible.       |
| 10      | Deliverable : Go through deliverables from week 8 and 9 and complete any missions functionalities and debug any issue which might occur.   |
| 11      | Deliverable :  Get some papers uploaded, take reviews about the project and suggestions for improvements.    |
| 12      | Deliverable : : Submit final report, materials, code on discourse and on github.,   **Submit Final Report + Code/Materials on Discourse #pulse**    |

### Plan for Communication with Mentor

I would be constantly in touch with the mentor to share my progress and any setbacks that might occur. I would have online meetings with my mentor once or twice a week depending upon the demand for the project through discord or through zoom meetings. 

### Plans to Continue with Project

This project is the primary thing I am working on and would continue working on the mission of DeSci in future.

### Candidate Details

### Motivation

I strongly believe that Science community should shift to web3 and blockchain. It would reduce the barrier and open doors for greater opportunities which would never be possible in web2. 

Background

I studied Physics major and Mathematics minor while persuing my Masters in Science. After that I worked as  a full stack developer and a data Scientist for year and a half. I am currently a kernel fellow.

### Working time and commitments

I would be devoting more than 40 hours per week on the project and I am fully commited to this project.
